My Github account was created for providing hosting source control repositories # Will0713.github.io
I created a repository which helps manage files and collaborating with team members.
The steps it took to clone the repository was fairly easy, i selected "Clone a repository" and it showed a list of the repositiry and i choose the one with my name.
